            <p>
            Union minister Thaawarchand Gehlot launched a scheme in Gujarat that provides for physical aids and assisted-living devices for senior citizens below the poverty line.
The scheme is called Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana and was launched on 1 April in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
The scheme aims to help senior citizens lead an independent and dignified life. At the launch in Gujarat, devices were distributed to senior citizens free of cost.
These devices will help the elderly people overcome their age-related physical disabilities and lead an independent life. The ambitious scheme is expected to benefit over five lakh senior citizens across India over a period of three years.
Under the scheme, aids and assisted-living devices like walking sticks, elbow crutches, walkers, tripods/quadpods, wheelchair, artificial dentures and spectacles are provided free of cost to eligible senior citizens.

        <p className="tuto-foot-para">Mastering basic sign language opens the door to better communication and inclusivity. By learning essential signs like greetings, numbers, colors, and days of the week, you can engage in meaningful conversations with the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Consistent practice and clear hand movements will improve your fluency and confidence over time. Sign language is not just about hand gestures—it also involves facial expressions and body language to convey emotions and meaning. Keep practicing, stay patient, and enjoy the journey of learning this beautiful language.</p>
