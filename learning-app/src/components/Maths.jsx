            <h2>Sum</h2>
            <p>
            The sign for "sum" represents the total of added numbers. One hand stays open, palm up, while the other taps it to show addition. Finally, both hands come together to indicate the total. This sign is useful for discussing basic math in sign language.            </p>

            <h2>Substract</h2>
            <p>
            The sign for "subtract" represents taking away a number from another. One hand is open with the palm facing up, while the other hand pulls fingers away to indicate removal. This gesture visually demonstrates subtraction in sign language. It is commonly used in mathematical discussions and everyday conversations. For example, it helps express equations like "10 minus 4 equals 6."

            <h2>Division</h2>
            <p>
            The sign for "division" represents the process of separating a number into equal parts. To perform this sign, one hand moves downward with two fingers extended, while the other hand mirrors the motion below, creating a visual separation. This gesture symbolizes division in mathematical discussions. It is commonly used to express equations like "8 divided by 2 equals 4."

            <h2>Tables</h2>
            <p>
            A multiplication table is a mathematical chart that displays the products of numbers when multiplied together. It helps learners quickly find answers to multiplication problems by organizing numbers in rows and columns. The table usually starts with smaller numbers, such as 1 to 10, making it easier to memorize basic multiplication facts. For example, in a standard multiplication table, 3 × 4 = 12 and  , 5 × 6 = 30. Understanding multiplication tables is essential for solving more complex math problems efficiently. They are widely used in schools to teach arithmetic and develop strong calculation skills.
